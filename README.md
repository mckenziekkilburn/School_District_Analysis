# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the Project
- It was shown, that in our original analysis of state-testing reading and math scores there was academic dishonesty. The 9th graders at Thomas High School showed evidence that some of the reading and math scores had appeared to of been altered. Furthermore, I was asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After doing so, I was told to run the original analysis again and write a report describing how these changes affected the overall analysis.

# Results
## How is the district summary affected?
##### Here is our results for after removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School.

##### Here is our original results.

- As shown in the images above, I would say that there is not a significant difference in the results but we will take a deeper look.

## Further Analysis
* How much difference did it make when we removed the ninth graders from Thomas High School?

#### Summary
- As we can see from the results below, we can conclude like previously stated there is not that much of a difference between the original and new results. To be exact there is only a .316608%. The below results are from the overall passing percentages.
